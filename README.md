# ArmBasedCodes-HAL-Library

The Projects Based on Hal Libraries for developing arm based micros specially STMs

1- HTU21D_STM32F103C8_HAL Library.rar :
  - Communicating "HTU21D" and send data over UART by HAL Library
  - This project contains a specified c-code(hal_HTU21D.c) and h-code(htu21d.h) file that has been written based on I2C HAL module driver     to communicate with HTU21D.
  - The program was developed on an example based on STM32F103C8 chip that sends datas over UART1.
  - Everybody who programming Arm-based chips based on HAL-Library can use this code.
